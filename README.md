## Overview
In this work, we propose a **lightweight macroscopic crowd prediction model** that:  
- Reduces inference time **3.6Ã—** compared to a high-dimensional baseline.  
- Improves prediction accuracy by **3.1%**.  
- Integrates with socially aware planners for real-time robot navigation.  

The model encodes pedestrian density, velocity, and variance on a grid, and forecasts spatiotemporal dynamics using a **ConvRNN-based encoder-forecaster**. Predictions are then integrated into a **PRM\*** planning framework for socially compliant navigation.
